# final_project

The project is a simple snake game built on turtle which we used and learned earlier in the semester.

For starters, the freegames module needs to be imported in order to use the vector and square functions in the code. This can be done using the command prompt with pip install freegames. This will allow us to use these key functions throughout the code. 

Essentially, the way the game works is there will be random "food" that shows up in any place on the screen. The goal of the game is to eat as many food as possible by running over it with the snake. The movement of the snake is controlled using the arrow keypad on the computer. If the snake hits a side of the screen or attempts to go back the way it is going then the game is over. The overall snake score will be displayed in the command prompt after the game
